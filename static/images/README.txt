IMPORTANT: Place your nirman.png image in this directory (static/images/)

This image is used as the hero background on the homepage. If nirman.png is not present, a gradient will be shown instead.

For best results:
1. Use a high-quality landscape image (at least 1920px wide)
2. Choose an image that represents your college fest NIRAMN 2K25
3. Make sure the image is named exactly "nirman.png" (all lowercase)

The image should be placed directly in this folder:
/static/images/nirman.png
